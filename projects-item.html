<p>This is a python program to simulate picking balls at ramdom from a Hat of balls of different colors and quantities. The program randonly picks balls from the Hat until it gets the required balls. This is called an experiment so the computer determines the number of times it needs to pick balls from the Hat to get the desired result. After thousands of experiments the computer can use one simple division to calculate the complex probabilty. This is because computers can o one million mathematical operations per second</p>

            <p>This is a python web scraper that uses Scrapy and Selenium to scrape all the products of the St Jacks webstie. Selenium is a powerful tool for controlling web browsers through a web driver and performing browser automation. It is functional for all browsers, works on all major OS and its scripts are written in various languages i.e Python, Java, C#, etc, we will be working with Python. Install Python version 3, Scrapy and Selenium to run this script.</p>
