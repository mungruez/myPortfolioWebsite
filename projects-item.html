<p>This is a Python program to simulate picking balls at ramdom from a Hat of balls of different colors and quantities. The program randomly picks balls from the Hat until it gets the required balls. This is called an experiment so the computer determines the number of times it needs to pick balls from the Hat to get the desired result. After thousands of experiments the computer can use one simple division to calculate the complex probabilty. This is because computers can do one million mathematical operations per second</p>

Selenium is a powerful tool for controlling web browsers through a web driver and performing browser automation. It is functional for all browsers, works on all major OS and its scripts are written in various languages i.e Python, Java, C#, etc, we will be working with Python. Install Python version 3, Scrapy and Selenium to run this script.</p>

  <p>Django is a loosely coupled, server side web application development framework written in Python that responds to requests and constructs a response for the client.</p>  
  <p>Whenever a request is received by the Django server , the server looks for a matching pattern in the url Patterns defined for the project, a 404 error is returned if no match id found. If a match id found the view file associated with the url is executed and sent as the response.</p> 
  <p>Django uses MVT the controller is the view in Django. Views are based on data from models.</p>  
  <p>In Django there can be many apps and each app has its own urls.py file. In the urls.py file for the project the individual urls.py files are used by using the includes function.<p/> 
  <p>A model in Django is a Python class derived from Django.db.models. A model is used to represent a table and map database entities to a table.</p> 
  <p> Serialisation is the process of converting Django models into other formats such as JSON, XML, CSV, etc.</p> 
  <p> The built in Django Admin interface allows making changes to database models registered in the admin.py file of the project.</p>
  <p>A View in Django is a class or function that receives a request and returns a response. A View gets data from the database using models and passes that data to a template (usually as a context dictionary).  After passing the data, the View then sends back the rendered template to the client as an HTTP response. Views also allow redirects to urls.</p>
  <p> Django Templates are used to dynamically generate web content  based on data passed in from the View.  The Django Templating Language parses, processes and converts the template to an HTTP response. Templates can be part of other templates in Django the extends and end block statements are used to insert sub-Templates as blocks into Templates.   
   The Django REST framework is a Django app and framework makes the creation of REST APIs easy.</p>
  <p>The Object Relational Mapper - In Django there is no need to query data with SQL. The ORM allows interacting with the database using an object of the model class. The ORM converts these SQL queries based on the database registered in the settings.py file for the Django project. A Query Set is a collection of objects from the database. A group of rows or records is returned as a Query Set.</p>  
  <p>Middleware is a layer in the Django request, response processing pipeline. Each Middleware performs functions on the request and or response, such as gzipping, caching, and authenticating.  Javascript  is added in Django by adding script tags into templates. Javascript and CSS files can be stored using Django.contrib.staticfiles and these static files can be used in Templates by using the link tag.</p>
  <p>This is a Django View written in Python. The View responds to requests by extracting a search term from the url then it uses beautiful soup to begins scraping craigslist for the extracted term. Once the list of results are fetched from craigslist the View sends the data with the response to the Template</p>

  <p>I like Django a lot and I have been using it for over 5 years. I completed the Python Django course on Udemy by Mr. Dennis Ivy and I have recently worked with the Django REST framework to design and implement  Views, Viewsets , Filters ,Unit Tests ,Serialisers, Templates, APIs, URL patterns, Styles and Models for a Django application. I have written view sets that use recursive actions to query data in a specific order. I love programming in Python which I have used for writing a cartoon yourself web application , a few Data Science applications and numerous awesome web scrapers and scripts. This is the link to my ⭐️”Python Django Cartoon Yourself Web Application” that can also scrape craigslist and indeed:  <a href="http://codedjangolist.herokuapp.com"> http://codedjangolist.herokuapp.com </a>  
      As a Software Engineer and Computer Scientist I prefer React for developing Front Ends for web applications with many components on the page , like the Facebook user profile page for example. Applications with search bars, chat boxes, news and weather sections, post lists and user lists on one page run better when components reload only when the user makes a change to one of them.  React also provides memoization for components that render the same elements every time they receive the same props, like a component for the daily news or weather for example. Django has pagination and views that help with long list but React  has a neat library that uses the window height to help with long lists as well as pagination.  Django can be used as a  powerful backend and one of its disadvantages is that it is too bulky. Django can handle heavy traffic, APIs are easy to build and it is scalable so it is an excellent choice to use as a backend for web applications with large number of users.  </p>
